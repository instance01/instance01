  I used to be very active in the Minecraft Bukkit plugin development scene. Most repositories on here are still from that time (but this is just a snapshot, I think it was 300 plugins over a span of ~3 years). At some point I did a lot of projects on a private [cgit](https://pi.instancedev.com/cgit/). Mostly application development and experiments (potential startup ideas), also some web reverse engineering and crawling. This helped with [Twitch-HLS-Adblock](https://github.com/instance01/Twitch-HLS-AdBlock), but I'm not active on that any longer: Currently I'm mostly doing research projects.
  
  If you have questions, would like to propose a project or want to add me on LinkedIn, don't hesitate to contact me via E-Mail (see on the left).
